# Latex Template Repo

This is a meta repository for bootstrapping new Latex documents.
Templates for more specific Latex document types are kept in branches.
To start a new document, just clone the suitable branch and adapt it.

## How to clone

To start a real project from a template, you may simply clone from that template.
To learn how to clone (or rather fork) from a template, go to the `README.md`
on the specific template branch that you want to clone. The `master` branch
itself is not intended for cloning, as it is not a template for anything.

## Files to Adjust

When starting a new document by cloning from this branch, you should edit the
following files to match your new document:

- `README.md` is this text you are just reading
- `LICENSE` is currently a copy of the MIT License
- `main.tex` is the Latex document

## More Specific Template Branches

- currently none
