# Template Repo

This is a meta repository for bootstrapping new projects.
Templates for various types of software projects are kept in branches.
To start a new project, just clone the suitable branch and adapt it.

## How to clone

To start a real project from a template, you may simply clone from that template.
To learn how to clone (or rather fork) from a template, go to the `README.md`
on the specific template branch that you want to clone. The `master` branch
itself is not intended for cloning, as it is not a template for anything.

## Files to Adjust

When starting a new project by cloning from a template branch, you should edit the
following files to match your new project:

- `README.md` is this text you are just reading
- `LICENSE` is currently a copy of the MIT License
